 
Portfolio Website README
Welcome to my Portfolio website! This site serves as a showcase for my professional journey, including the projects I've worked on, my internships, and my achievements. I’ve designed this website to not only present my work but to also make it easy for potential employers or collaborators to get in touch with me.

What You’ll Find on This Website
1. Projects
Throughout this portfolio, you’ll find a detailed display of the projects I’ve worked on. From personal projects to collaborations during my internship, I’ve provided descriptions, live demos, and sometimes even code snippets to give you an insight into my skills and thought processes.
2. Internships & Work Experience
I’ve included details about the internships I’ve completed. These experiences helped me grow professionally and gain hands-on skills. You’ll find descriptions of my responsibilities, the skills I developed, and the impact of my work.
3. Certificates & Achievements
A collection of certificates that demonstrate my qualifications and the hard work I've put into advancing my skills. You can view these certificates directly on the site, showing my continuous learning and dedication to growth.
4. Live Features
To make the portfolio more interactive and engaging, I’ve integrated live features on the website. These are designed to give you a better feel for my work and how I approach development. These features add a dynamic touch to the portfolio, ensuring that it isn’t just static content.
5. Contact Me
I’ve also added a contact form that allows visitors to easily reach out to me directly. Whether you're interested in collaboration, job opportunities, or just want to connect, feel free to send a message through the site.
6. Why No CV Attached?
I have not attached my CV to this site because I believe in presenting my skills and accomplishments directly through the work shown here. However, if you're an employer or potential partner who would like to see my CV, you can request it via the contact form. I’m happy to provide it!
7. Missing Final Year Project
Unfortunately, I was unable to include my final year project on the website. This project was hosted on my university’s servers, and since I’m no longer a student, I no longer have access to it. I made the mistake of not downloading a local copy before graduation. If you're interested in learning more about it, feel free to ask me through the contact form, and I’ll be happy to discuss it further!
Conclusion
I’ve built this website as a reflection of my skills, experience, and the dedication I bring to every project. I hope it gives you a clear idea of what I can offer and why I’d be a great fit for your team. If you have any questions or want to discuss opportunities, don’t hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to hearing from you!
